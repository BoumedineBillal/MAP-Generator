![Sokoban Map Generator](images/sokoban_gui.png)

## Description

This is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application for creating and generating Sokoban game maps. The application allows users to design custom Sokoban levels using different elements like the player, walls, boxes, and targets, and then save these maps as text files.

The GUI is built using the `tkinter` library, and users can interactively design maps by clicking and dragging elements on the grid.

## Features

- **Grid Customization**: Define the number of rows, columns, and the cell size of the map grid.
- **Element Placement**: Place elements such as the Player, Walls, Boxes, and Targets on the grid via simple click or drag actions.
- **Save Map**: Save the created Sokoban map to a text file in a simple format for future use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (included with most Python installations)
